And Minerva said, "There is no fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope
has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true, what is the
meaning of all this feasting, and who are these people? What is it all about?
Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the family—for no one seems to
be bringing any provisions of his own? And the guests—how atrociously they are
behaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough to disgust
any respectable person who comes near them."

"Sir," said Telemachus, "as regards your question, so long as my father was
here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their displeasure
have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mortal
man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better even though he were dead,
if he had fallen with his men before Troy, or had died with friends around him
when the days of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have
built a mound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown;
but now the storm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone
without leaving so much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing but
dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father;
heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all
our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also
all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the
pretext of paying their court to my mother, who will neither point blank say
that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; so they are making
havoc of my estate, and before long will do so also with myself."

"Is that so?" exclaimed Minerva, "then you do indeed want Ulysses home again.
Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he is the man he
 was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and making merry, he would
 soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors, were he to stand once more
 upon his own threshold. He was then coming from Ephyra, where he had been to
 beg poison for his arrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the
 ever-living gods and would not give him any, but my father let him have some,
 for he was very fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors
 will have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.
