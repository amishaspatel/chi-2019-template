"I hope, sir," said he, "that you will not be offended with what I am going to
say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it, and all this is done
at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding to
powder in the surf. If these men were to see my father come back to Ithaca
they would pray for longer legs rather than a longer purse, for money would
not serve them; but he, alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people
do sometimes say that he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see
him again. And now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and where you
come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in,
how your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nation they declared
themselves to beâ€”for you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly, for I
want to know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in my
father's time? In the old days we had many visitors for my father went about
much himself."
